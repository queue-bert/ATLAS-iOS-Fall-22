Queer Sex Ed App

main points:
    this would be a read only app where anyone could access the information without having to sign in
    very friendly user interface with bright, welcoming colors

features:
    search functionality that can direct you to various articles or sections in the app
        (advanced) i would love to add functionality for a chat bot that could take what questions a person has and spit out a response based on the content available within the app

    still debating on how i would structure the content but thinking that it could be divided based on big topics like STDs and contraception but also more holistic topics like relationships and values of self-worth

    maybe sex journal thing to encourage people to explore and document their sexuality and sexual experiences
